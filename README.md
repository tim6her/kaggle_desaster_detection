Twitter Desaster Detection
==========================

This repository contains my submission to the
*Advanced Data Science Capstone* course by *IBM* hosted by *Coursera*.

The data is provided by *Kaggle* which describes the challenge as follows:

> Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
> The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency
> they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are
> interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief
> organizations and news agencies).
>
> But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing
> a disaster.
