Training data is provided in *CSV* format.
All data is provided in a single file, which has the following schema.

```
root
 |-- id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- keyword: string (nullable = true)
 |-- location: string (nullable = true)
 |-- text: string (nullable = true)
 |-- target: integer (nullable = true)
```

Data is accessed via the official *Kaggle* API. Access credentials are
stored in the object cloud and are retrieved when running the notebook.


### Justification

Using the official API ensures access to the data in accordance to *Kaggleâ€˜s*
usage policies.
Additionally, data can be accessed in a reproducable way and no input data
needs to be uploaded.

The *CSV* format is chosen, as it is the data format provided by *Kaggle*.

No realtime data access is needed during the training.
